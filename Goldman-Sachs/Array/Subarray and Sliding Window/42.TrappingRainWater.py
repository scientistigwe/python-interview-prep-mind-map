        Imagine you're working for a high-frequency trading firm. You're given an array of integers
        representing price fluctuations of a particular stock over time. Each integer represents
        the price difference from the previous timestamp.

        Your task is to create an algorithm that maximizes trading profits by identifying optimal
        buy and sell points. You can think of positive integers as potential profits and negative
        integers as potential losses.

        The challenge is to find the maximum cumulative profit that can be made by making a series
        of trades, where each trade consists of buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price.

        :param price_fluctuations: List of integers representing price changes over time
        :return: Maximum possible cumulative profit

            if price_fluctuations[left] < price_fluctuations[right]:
                if price_fluctuations[left] >= left_max:
                    # Update the highest price seen from the left
                    left_max = price_fluctuations[left]
                else:
                    # Calculate profit for this trade
                    total_profit += left_max - price_fluctuations[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if price_fluctuations[right] >= right_max:

# Follow-up questions and answers:
#
# Q: What is the time complexity of this algorithm?
# A: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. We traverse the list once using two pointers, performing constant time operations at each step.
# Q: What is the space complexity of this algorithm?
# A: The space complexity is O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size, only utilizing a few variables to keep track of pointers and maximum values.
# Q: How would you modify this algorithm if you were limited to making only one trade (one buy and one sell)?
# A: To find the maximum profit with only one trade, we could use a single pass through the array, keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that could be made by selling at the current price. This would also be O(n) time and O(1) space.
# Q: Can you explain how this algorithm relates to the original "Trapping Rain Water" problem?
# A: The algorithm is essentially the same. In the rain water problem, we're finding how much water can be trapped between "walls". In this financial scenario, we're finding how much profit can be made between price points. The mathematics and logic behind both problems are identical.
# Q: How would you handle real-world constraints like transaction fees or limits on the number of trades per day?
# A: To account for transaction fees, we could subtract a fee from each profitable trade. If there's a limit on the number of trades per day, we could modify the algorithm to keep a count of trades and stop when we reach the limit, or we could implement a greedy approach to only make the most profitable trades within the limit.
# Q: In a real trading scenario, how might you adapt this algorithm to work with streaming data?
# A: For streaming data, we could use a sliding window approach. As new data comes in, we would update our window, maintaining the left_max and right_max values. We'd need to decide on an appropriate window size based on the specific trading strategy and market conditions.

# Complexity Analysis:
#
# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. We traverse the list once from both ends towards the middle.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
#
# This algorithm is efficient for large datasets, which is crucial in high-frequency trading where quick decisions need to be made based on large volumes of market data. Its constant space complexity also makes it memory-efficient, which is important when dealing with limited resources or when the algorithm needs to be deployed in environments with memory constraints.
